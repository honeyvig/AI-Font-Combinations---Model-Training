# AI-Font-Combinations---Model-Training
custom AI model built via machine learning:

- trained on a large dataset of fonts to recognise font styles, characteristics, and pairing compatibilities. (You'll have to source the datasets - not provided)

- This dataset would include properties such as typography styles, common pairings, and usage scenarios.

- Once trained, the model should be able to dynamically pair and match up any fonts provided to it.
==========================
Creating a custom AI model to recognize and pair fonts based on their typography styles, characteristics, and usage scenarios involves several steps, including dataset preparation, model selection, training, and deployment. Below is an outline of the steps to create such a model using Python and machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Steps:

    Dataset Collection:
        First, you need to collect a large dataset of fonts, ideally with metadata that includes font properties (e.g., serif vs sans-serif, weight, style, etc.), font pairings, and usage scenarios (e.g., web design, print, headings, body text).
        Datasets like Google Fonts or Font Squirrel could be a good start, but you will need to manually curate or source a large dataset with font pairings.
        You may need to use tools like FontForge to extract font properties or metadata for training.

    Preprocessing:
        Convert font data into a format that can be used for training, such as extracting key features from the fonts (e.g., font style, weight, spacing, curves, and other typography features).
        For machine learning, it would help to represent the fonts in a numerical format, using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings for font properties.

    Model Design:
        We’ll use a neural network for this task, which can take font properties as input and output compatibility or pairings. You could use a feed-forward neural network or convolutional neural network (CNN) depending on whether you are dealing with images of fonts or structured data like font properties.

    Model Training:
        The model needs to be trained to recognize font pairings and characteristics. You will train it on a dataset with labels that indicate which fonts are compatible with each other (e.g., heading + body text fonts).

    Font Pairing Prediction:
        Once trained, the model should be able to recommend compatible fonts based on user input. The input could be a list of fonts, and the model would output a list of recommended pairings.

Here's an example Python code for training such a model using machine learning concepts (TensorFlow/Keras):

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Sample dataset structure (you will need to source your dataset)
# Each row will represent a font with its features and the corresponding pairings
# Example: ['font_name', 'serif_or_sans', 'weight', 'width', 'recommended_pair']

# Example dataset for fonts and pairings
font_data = [
    {'font_name': 'Roboto', 'serif_or_sans': 0, 'weight': 400, 'width': 5, 'pairing': 'Open Sans'},
    {'font_name': 'Georgia', 'serif_or_sans': 1, 'weight': 700, 'width': 4, 'pairing': 'Arial'},
    {'font_name': 'Montserrat', 'serif_or_sans': 0, 'weight': 600, 'width': 3, 'pairing': 'Roboto'},
    # More font data here...
]

# Convert data into a pandas DataFrame for easy handling
df = pd.DataFrame(font_data)

# Preprocess font features and pairings
X = df[['serif_or_sans', 'weight', 'width']]  # Features: serif/sans, weight, width
y = df['pairing']  # Labels: recommended pairings

# Convert categorical labels (font pairings) to numeric
y = pd.get_dummies(y)  # One-hot encoding for pairings

# Split the data into training and test sets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Build a neural network model for font pairing prediction
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.InputLayer(input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(y_train.shape[1], activation='softmax')  # Output layer for classification (font pairings)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc}")

# Example function to recommend font pairings
def recommend_font_pairing(font):
    # Preprocess the input font data
    input_data = np.array([[font['serif_or_sans'], font['weight'], font['width']]])

    # Predict the recommended pairings
    predicted_pairing = model.predict(input_data)
    
    # Get the font pair name based on the highest probability
    recommended_font_idx = np.argmax(predicted_pairing)
    recommended_font = y.columns[recommended_font_idx]
    
    return recommended_font

# Example input for font prediction (e.g., 'Roboto', serif=0, weight=400, width=5)
font_example = {'serif_or_sans': 0, 'weight': 400, 'width': 5}
recommended_font = recommend_font_pairing(font_example)
print(f"Recommended font pairing: {recommended_font}")

Steps Explained:

    Dataset Preparation:
        The dataset font_data contains information about different fonts and their properties (serif/sans, weight, width). The pairing column holds the font pairings for each font, which is used as the label for training.
        You would need a much larger dataset for this model to be practical. Ideally, the dataset should include various combinations of font styles and pairings.

    Data Preprocessing:
        Features like serif_or_sans, weight, and width are used as input to the model.
        Font pairings (labels) are one-hot encoded to transform them into a format suitable for training a classification model.

    Model Architecture:
        A simple feed-forward neural network (fully connected layers) is used here with two hidden layers (128 and 64 neurons), which can be adjusted based on the complexity of the problem and the dataset size.
        The output layer uses softmax to generate probabilities for each font pairing.

    Training:
        The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function, which is appropriate for multi-class classification problems.
        Training is done on the dataset, and the model’s accuracy is evaluated on the test set.

    Font Pairing Recommendation:
        Once the model is trained, you can input a set of font properties (e.g., serif/sans, weight, width) into the recommend_font_pairing function, and it will predict the most compatible font pairing based on the learned relationships.

Next Steps for Improvement:

    Dataset Expansion:
        For this model to work well, you need to gather and label a much larger dataset with diverse font styles and pairings. You can scrape font pairings from websites like Google Fonts or Font Pair.

    Advanced Features:
        You can introduce additional features like font usage scenarios (e.g., "headings", "body text") or even font images (using convolutional neural networks).

    Model Improvement:
        Consider using more advanced models, such as Transformer-based models or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), if you plan to use images or more complex relationships between fonts.

    Real-Time Recommendations:
        Once trained, the model can be deployed as a web or desktop application to provide real-time font pairing recommendations based on user input.

Libraries and Frameworks:

    TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training neural networks.
    Scikit-learn: For preprocessing, splitting data, and evaluating the model.
    Pandas: For data manipulation.
    NumPy: For numerical computations.

Notes:

    The model above assumes you're working with numerical representations of fonts. If you're working with images of fonts or more detailed typography features, the approach would need to be modified to handle image data, possibly using CNNs.
    The dataset used here is very basic. You will need a large, well-curated dataset to train the model effectively for practical use.
